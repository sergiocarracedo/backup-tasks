# backup-task

# Requisites

PHP >=7.0
Composer

You need to install dependencies using
`composer install`


# Basic usage

First you need to create a yml file that list backup taks and a settings.yml file to config, for example the notifier

You can use `settings.example.yml`, just rename to `settings.yml`

I also provide a `tasks.example.yml` in `examples` folder
